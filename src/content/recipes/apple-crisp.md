title: Apple Crisp
time: 60 minutes

### Ingredients:

Apples:
- 10 cups apples, peeled, cored and sliced thin
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Topping:
- 1 ½ cup quick-cooking oats
- 1 ½ cup all-purpose flour
- 1 ½ cup packed brown sugar
- ¼ teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- ¾ cup butter, melted


### Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 350 F.
2. Mix the apples, sugar, flour, and cinnamon in a large mixing bowl. Transfer to a 9 x 13 pan and let sit for half an hour. (This brings out the juices and can be skipped if you add a few tablespoons of water. This isn’t as good though).
3. Combine the oats, flour, brown sugar, baking powder, baking soda and melted butter. Crumble evenly over the apple mixture. Top with a sprinkle of cinnamon.
4. Bake at 350 F for 45 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before serving.

### Notes:

- Any type of apple will work, but firmer apples work best.
