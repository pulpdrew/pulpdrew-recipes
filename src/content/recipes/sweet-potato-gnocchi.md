### Ingredients


Gnocchi
- 1 large sweet potato
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt (or 1/2 tsp table salt)
- 2ish cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed

Brown Butter Sauce
- 1/4 cup of butter
- a bit of salt
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder (optional)

### Directions

1. Prick the potato several times with a knife or a fork. Microwave 5-8 minutes, until soft. Let cool briefly.

2. Cut the potato in half and scoop the flesh into a bowl. Add salt and egg, then stir until smooth. Stir in the flour until a dough forms.

3. Transfer the dough onto a floured surface and knead in additional flour until the dough is no longer sticky.

4. Divide the dough into 3-4 pieces and roll each piece into a long rope, about 3/4 inch thick (or however thick you want your gnocchi). Cut each rope into 3/4 inch long pieces. Let dry for 20ish minutes.

4. Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat.  Let this cook for 2-4 minutes, until the butter begins to brown (but don't burn it!)

5. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Then add gnocchi for 3-5 minutes, until they float to the top. 

6. Transfer the gnocchi into the melted butter and saute until the lightly browned. Add salt and garlic powder to taste.
