5. Remove it from the heat and add in the dijon mustard, nutritional yeast, onion powder, garlic powder, smoked paprika, salt and pepper and whisk.
6. Add the cooked macaroni into the pot of sauce and mix gently until pasta is covered.Then transfer to a 9×13 baking dish and smooth down.
7. Prepare the crumb topping by mixing the breadcrumbs and 2 Tbsp melted margarine with a fork. Sprinkle the topping over the macaroni.
8. Bake for 20-25 minutes until the topping is golden brown and crispy.


### Notes

- Chicken stock can be used in place of veggie stock, but is not vegan.
- Smoked paprika is much better than other paprika, in this recipe
- Coconut milk will be the most creamy option, but 5 cups of unsweetend soy milk will work as well.
