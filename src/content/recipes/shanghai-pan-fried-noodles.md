### Ingredients:

#### Pork and Marinade:

- 8oz pork chop, or other lean pork
- 1/2 tsp dark soy sauce<sup>1</sup>
- 1 tsp light soy sauce
- 1 tsp cornstarch
- 1 tbsp Shaoxing Chinese Cooking Wine<sup>2</sup>

#### Noodles and Sauce:

- 1 lb Udon or Chao Mian noodles, cooked. <sup>3</sup>
- 1 tbsp dark soy sauce<sup>1</sup>
- 1 tbsp light soy sauce
- 2 tsp sugar
- 1/4 tsp ground black pepper
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1 tsp or 2 cloves minced garlic
- 1-2 cups baby bok choy, washed and broken up a bit.<sup>4</sup>

### Directions:

1. Cut the pork into 1/8 inch thin strips. Mix with the wine, cornstarch, light and dark soy sauce. Leave to marinate for at least 15 minutes.
2. Make the sauce by combining the light and dark soy sauces, sugar, black pepper, and sesame oil. Set aside.
3. Add some vegetable or peanut oil (~2 tsp) to a large pan or wok over medium high heat. Fry the pork in its marinade for 3-5 minutes, until each strip is cooked. Remove from the pan and set aside.
4. Add the garlic to the pan. Fry for a minute.
5. Add the sauce and the noodles to the pan, fry for 5 minutes, stirring the noodles occasionally to cover in sauce.
6. Add the bok choy and pork, cook until the bok choy is tender, but still firm, about 5 minutes.
7. Remove from heat, optionally sprinkle with some green onions, and serve.

### Notes

<sup>1</sup> If you don't have this, try to get some at a Chinese or Asian grocery store. If you can't find it, just substitute light soy sauce and an extra teaspoon of sugar in the sauce (not the marinade).

<sup>2</sup> If you don't have this, try to get some at a Chinese or Asian grocery store. If you can't find it, see [here](https://www.fitibility.com/shaoxing-wine-substitutes/) for substitutes.

<sup>3</sup> I found pre-cooked frozen Udon at an Asian grocery. Some regular grocery stores may have Udon. This recipe won't be as satisfying with noodles that are thinner.

<sup>4</sup> If you can't find this, substitute some cabbage.
