### Ingredients:

- 1.5 cups rice (dry)
- 1 lb boneless chicken breast or thigh, cut into small pieces.
- 1.5 Tbsp Thai Chili Paste (nam prik pao)
- 1 Tbsp fish sauce
- 2 Tbsp soy sauce
- 3-5 Cloves of garlic, minced or ground into paste
- Up to 1 tsp of dried red pepper (or other chili) flakes. Omit to reduce spiciness.
- 1 onion, diced
- Some other sort of veggie (I prefer chopped up bok choy)
- 1 cup basil (preferably Thai or holy)
- 1 fresh chili pepper, cut into thin slices

### Directions:

1. Cook the rice, then spread it out on a plate to cool and dry out in the fridge for a while.
2. Marinate the cut chicken in 1 Tbsp Soy Sauce, 1 tsp sugar, and 1 Tbsp water for 30 minutes to an hour.
3. Mix the Chili Paste, Fish Sauce, and 1 Tbsp Soy Sauce. Set aside.
4. In a large pan over high heat, cook the chicken until done. Remove and set aside.
5. In the same pan, scramble the eggs. Remove and set aside with the chicken.
6. In the same pan, briefly saute the garlic and red pepper flakes in a bit of oil until fragrant.
7. Add onion and other solid veggies and saute for a few more minutes.
8. Add the rice then mix in the sauce. Stir until everything is coated and the rice is no longer clumpy.
9. Turn off the heat, then add the basil, any other leafy veg., and sliced chili. Stir until slightly wilted. Serve.
